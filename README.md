# Data Analyst Portfolio
### Introduction
My name is Brendan Willis and I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Mathematics and concentrations in statistics and actuarial science. I also have an economics minor.

As a Mathematics major, I have taken several classes involving data analysis. Telling stories with data and learning about different things through analysis is a passion of mine. I have analyzed data on Python, R, and Stata and am confident I could quickly pick up any other software. This repository is meant to display some of the projects I have completed in school.

Enjoy!
