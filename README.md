# Data Analyst Portfolio
## Introduction
My name is Brendan Willis and I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Mathematics and concentrations in statistics and actuarial science. I also have an economics minor.

As a Mathematics major, I have taken several classes involving data analysis. Telling stories with data and learning about different things through analysis is a passion of mine. I have analyzed data on Python, R, and Stata and am confident I could quickly pick up any other software. This repository is meant to display some of the projects I have completed in school.

Enjoy!

## Projects

### Project 1 - Data Wrangling
This small project displays my ability to wrangle and clean data on R. I used the 'covidcast' package on R to query over data and pull out observations I was interested in. In this case I pulled out covid data for counties near where I live between 2020 and 2022. I then made some tables to investigate covid rates in these places. Then, I pulled out data for all counties in the United States in the month of January 2022 so I could make an interactive table with the county from each state with that max covid rate from that month. This project isn't so much about getting results from the data; its main purpose is to display my ability to work with data on R. 

### Project 2 - Word Game
This is a simple word game I made on Python. It displays my knowledge of data structures and functions in Python. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. Immediately upon running the program the user will be shown their 'hand', which consists of 15 random letters. The user will be asked if they would like to substitute anyof the letters in their hand. If they type 'yes' all copies of the letter they would like to substitute will be removed from their hand and replaced with a new letter. The user then enters words until their hand is empty or they quit by typing '!!'. The program calculates the score of each word based off of scrabble letter scores. Although this project doesn't involve data it requires relevant skills like indexing and use of data structures.
