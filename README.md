# Data Analyst Portfolio
### Introduction
My name is Brendan Willis and I am currently a senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I will be graduating in May with a degree in Mathematics and concentrations in statistics and actuarial science. I also have an economics minor.

My initial plan was to become an actuary; but after taking my first analysis class I knew I wanted to pursue a career in data. Since then, I have gone out of my way to take as many data analysis classes as possible in order to refine my skills. I have taken analysis based classes in public health, finance, economics, and statistics meaning I know how to analyze data from many different areas. I know how to analyze data in python, R, and Stata but am confident I could quickly pick up any other software.
